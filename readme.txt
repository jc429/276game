DR. WADDLE'S TOTALLY NOT SMASH BROS FIGHTING SIMULATOR 2015
*All graphics not mine. Except that sexy sexy HUD*

Controls:

Space - Pause
Esc - Quit

P1:
WASD to move
Z or X to attack

P2:
Arrows to move
O or P to attack

Notes:
Because Dr. Doom normally would ne too tall to punch Waddle Dee, I pushed him farther down to compensate.
This resulted in silly graphics but it was the quickest way to make Dr. Doom capable of winning.

Due to the limitations of computer keyboards, only 3-4 inputs max will register at one time.
Pretend it's hard mode or something.

Waddle Dee has a double jump. Use it. Abuse it.
