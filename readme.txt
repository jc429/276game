DR. WADDLE'S TOTALLY NOT SMASH BROS FIGHTING SIMULATOR 2015
*All graphics not mine. Except that sexy sexy HUD*

WARNING: I funked up real good and compiled my project as C++ code. It compiles fine if you make it a C++ project, but as you could imagine making it a C project produces over 100 errors. I'll fix this ASAP.


Controls:

Space - Pause (VS Mode)
--While Paused, press (left) Alt to advance one frame.
Esc - Quit (VS), Exit Program (anywhere else)

P1:
WASD to move
Z or X to attack

P2:
Arrows to move
O or P to attack

Notes:
-Collision is janky on small characters. I'm looking into it.

-Debug Man has no hit or hurtboxes apparently.

-Due to the limitations of computer keyboards, only 3-4 inputs max will register at one time.
Pretend it's hard mode or something.
